# Crate setup

First thing first: this book is written against this following luminance crate setup:

```toml
luminance = "0.37"
luminance-derive = "0.5"
luminance-windowing = "0.8"
luminance-glfw = "0.11"
```

If you are using a version from crates.io that si more recent that this current book, feel free to
ask via an [issue](https://github.com/phaazon/luminance-rs/issues) to update the book! The goal is
to keep it as updated as possible, but it might happen it lags a bit behind. Sorry for that.

Even though some other crates exist (windowing, for most), we are not going to focus on them and
will stick to the ones above.
