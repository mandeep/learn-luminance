# What is a triangle?

Everyone knows what a triangle is… but what is a triangle on your GPU? In [luminance], a triangle
can be _represented_ in lots of ways. In our case:

  - A triangle has three vertices.
  - Each vertex has a position in 2D, represented by two floating point values on 32-bit.
  - Each vertex has a color, represented as RGB.

The first thing to do is to create… types. You will see throughout this wiki that [luminance] is
very type-oriented. Don’t freak out. [luminance] requires you to define your type in a way it can
acknowledge how vertices’ data are formed. The following, for instance, will not work:

```rust
type Position = (f32, f32);
type RGB = (u8, u8, u8);
type Vertex = (Position, RGB);
```

But the real vertex definition is very, very similar. Hang on.

## Defining your vertex type

In order to define our vertex type, we need to create a `struct` that will implement the [`Vertex`]
trait. That trait requires various information to be provided by the implementor and you don’t even
have to worry about those because a crate exists to automatically implement such a trait:
[luminance-derive].

First thing first: add [luminance-derive] to your project’s `[dependencies]` section:

```toml
luminance-derive = "0.5"
```

Simple. One last thing: when you will use the `Vertex` derive annotation, you will have to provide
a _vertex semantics_ type, implementing the [`Semantics`] trait. Again, you don’t have to implement
such a trait by hand: [luminance-derive] will handle all that for you.

Vertex semantics are a way to tell [luminance] what the relationship between _all_ objects you
intend to create and the way they will be rendered is about. In our case, we just only need two
semantics: _vertex positions_ and _vertex colors_. Let’s create our semantics type:

```rust
use luminance_derive::Semantics;
```

Our proc-macro derive, yay. Let’s use it:

```rust
#[derive(Copy, Clone, Debug, Semantics)]
pub enum VertexSemantics {
  #[sem(name = "position", repr = "[f32; 2]", wrapper = "VertexPosition")]
  Position,
  #[sem(name = "color", repr = "[u8; 3]", wrapper = "VertexRGB")]
  Color
}
```

> Woah, that’s a lot of new syntax!

Indeed, let’s dig the syntax:

  - The `Semantics` derive annotation marks an `enum` as being representative of _vertex semantics_.
    Currently, nothing else than `enum`s are supported.
  - The type implementing `Semantics` must also implement [`Copy`], [`Clone`] and [`Debug`].
  - Each variant of the `enum` represents a distinct _vertex semantics_.
  - The syntax `#[sem(..)]` provides several mandatory information:
    - The `name = "position"` annotation gives [luminance] a way to recognize the semantics in
      _shader stages_. You don’t have to worry about what it means so far but keep in mind that
      identifier must be unique.
    - `repr = "[f32; 2]"` tells which is the underlying expected type of the semantics. That
      constructs a strongly-typed assumption about the semantics. A `"position"` is a 2D `f32`.
      Period. You have a large list of type you can use here but you are limited to the implementors
      of [`VertexAttrib`].
    - The `wrapper = "VertexPosition"` annotation generates a new type called `VertexPosition` and
      in scope in the module you declared the `enum`. That type is the only one which is recognized
      as being usable with the `Semantics` `enum` you just declared — it implements the
      [`HasSemantics`] trait for which `HasSemantics::Sem = VertexSemantics`.

All of this might be a bit confusing; let’s clarify even further. When you declare an `enum`
annotated with `#[derive(Copy, Clone, Debug, Semantics)]`, [luminance-derive] does automatically
implement [`Semantics`] for you and generate as many types as variants in your `enum`. Those types
represent _vertex attributes_ types you will be able to use to construct types that will correctly
implement the [`Vertex`] trait.

Talking about [`Vertex`], let’s go and define our vertex type. The `Vertex` derive annotation works
only on `struct`s, so let’s create one. Import the `Vertex` proc-macro first:

```rust
use luminance_derive::{Semantics, Vertex};
```

And then define your `Vertex` type (it’s possible to use the same typename because proc-macro won’t
clash with types):

```rust
#[derive(Vertex)]
#[vertex(sem = "VertexSemantics")]
pub struct Vertex {
  position: VertexPosition,
  #[vertex(normalized = "true")]
  color: VertexRGB
}
```

A new syntax! So:

  - The `Vertex` derive annotation marks a `struct` as being a valid _vertex_ type. Currently, only
    `struct` with fields are supported.
  - The `#[vertex(sem = "VertexSemantics")]` provides a mapping to a type that represents your
    _vertex semantics_.
  - Each field must have a type that implements `HasSemantics<Sem = VertexSemantics>` in that case.
    Don’t forget about the `wrapper` types that got generated with the `Semantics` derive: those
    types are valid as fields’ types here.
  - The special `#[vertex(normalized = "true")]` annotation marks a field as being _normalized_.
    Normalized fields make sense when the field has an integral type, such as `[u8; 3]`, which is
    _unsigned integral_. When trying to fetch normalized vertex attribute, a _shader stage_ will get
    normalized floating point numbers (lying in `[0; 1]`) instead of the typical e.g. `[0; 255]`.

And we are good to go as our vertex type is now live!

## Defining a triangle

A triangle is just three points — three vertices. Let’s define them.

```rust
const VERTICES: [Vertex; 3] = [
  Vertex { position: VertexPosition::new([-0.5, -0.5]), color: VertexRGB::new([255,   0,   0]) },
  Vertex { position: VertexPosition::new([ 0.5, -0.5]), color: VertexRGB::new([  0, 255,   0]) },
  Vertex { position: VertexPosition::new([  0.,  0.5]), color: VertexRGB::new([  0,   0, 255]) },
];
```

It’s that simple.

> Disclaimer: an on-going patch will soon allow to build vertices with `const fn` at the vertex type
> level too; not only the vertex attributes.

## The final part of the recipe: GPU tessellations

> Tessellations?

In [luminance], everything that has a _vertex_ or _must be rendered_ is done via a _tessellation_ as
described by the [`Tess`] type. GPU tessellations provide information about:

  - The nature of the topology of the underlying _vertex mesh_. That is, zero, one or several
    buffers describing the raw topology of the mesh.
  - The way vertices are linked to each other. That is done via several ways that are going to be
    explored in this wiki, but so far, we’ll stick to _primitive modes_, encoded via the [`Mode`]
    type.
  - And a lot of cool features you should be impatient to discover, but everything happens to those
    who wait. ;)

Creating a [`Tess`] will upload our vertices to the GPU so that we have an object (i.e. [`Tess`]) to
manipulate and render our triangle. However, one does not simply create a [`Tess`]: we need
[`TessBuilder`], which follows the [builder pattern].

![](./imgs/one-does-not-simply-create-tess-without-builder.jpg)

Let’s see the code to create our [`Tess`] via [`TessBuilder`].

```rust
use luminance::tess::{Mode, TessBuilder};
```

You really thought you wouldn’t need to import those?

```rust
// at the beginning of main_loop
let triangle = TessBuilder::new(&mut surface)
  .add_vertices(VERTICES)
  .set_mode(Mode::Triangle)
  .build()
  .unwrap();
```

If you don’t specify the [`Mode`], the [`TessBuilder`] defaults to [`Mode::Point`], which will not
connect your vertices between them and will leave three independent points on your screen. Also,
in a production application, you shouldn’t use `.unwrap()` but instead propagate the error or
treat it.

We have everything we need to represent our triangle on GPU with [luminance]. Let’s go on and see
how we can render it into our frame buffer.
